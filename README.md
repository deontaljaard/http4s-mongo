# http4s-mongo
A reference project intended to be a starting point (reference) to use http4s and mongo

Working with the latest technology means that there's not always sufficient documentation for your use case. I started tinkering with http4s and the new async|reactive drivers for MongoDB. I thought I'd share it here for anybody else that were interested in using similar techonologies.
